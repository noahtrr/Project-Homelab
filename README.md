# Project Homelab

This repository is supposed to resemble my Docker homelab architecture which is running on a pi 5

# The vision

    - Have full OIDC integration for every service
    - Not relying on external services
    - Mesh VPN with Headscale to circumvent the user limit on the Tailscale free plan

# What does this accomplish

    - Have a homelab with everything one might need
    - ADBLOCKING
    - Connect to the homelab from anywhere
    - Be able to throw the pi into any network and it just working 

# Planned additions

    - FOSSFlow
    - Grafana
    - Prometheus
    - RomM
